Writeup Lab 4

Describe any design decisions you made.
Ex1: Used an array of buckets to record the heights of the bars. No changes were made for StringHistogram.
Ex2: First obtained the relevant TupleDesc, then checked and created the histograms. Used another scan to build the histograms and estimate the costs.
Ex3: Applied a simple estimation method. Specifically, for range scans, used 30% of the product of cardinalities as the cost.
Ex4: Implemented the Selinger optimizer according to the pseudocode.

Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.
To my knowledge, no changes were necessary.

Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.
To my knowledge, there are no missing or incomplete elements.

Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.
