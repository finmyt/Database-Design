simpleDB lab1

Exercise 1
Use ArrayList to manage the TupeDesc of a table.

Exercise 2
Create a supplemental class called CatalogItem to store the table infomation.
Use a hashmap to store CatalogItem, and the index is ID of DBFile.
Use a hashmap to store the mapping from name to ID, in order to find the table using name.

Exercise3
Create an Array to store pages, a hashmap to store the mapping from PageId to the index of page array, and bitsets to store the status of each page.
A simple cache is implemented by storing the pages which are not in the page array before into the array.

Exercise 4
Use the combination of tableId + pageNo as HeapPageId, and pageId + tupleNo as RecordId.
Create a new Iterator class ValidTupleIterator to iterate the valid tuples.

Exercise5
Create a new Iterator class HeapFileTupleIterator to iterate the tuples in the heapfile.
Use RandomFileAccess to access pages in disk files. WARNING: Must use seek() to set the file pointer before read().

Exercise 6
Format the TupleDesc, then use TupleIterator in DBFile to iterator the tuples.

API Changes£º
TupleDesc.java:
Add function getLength() to get the number of columns of the table.
Add function getTDItem(int i) to get the i-th TDItem of the TupleDessc.

Missing or Incomplete Elements
No

Commits of Myself
I spent about 3 days (I also have other works in these days) in this lab. Due to my lack of prior experience with Java, I spent a significant amount of time configuring the environment and understanding the code. This lab has been quite challenging for me.
